##DNAScript 
---------------------------------------------------

First and foremost, I apologize for the excessive commenting in the source.


Source code contains four .scala files:

DNADatum: A class definition for the only data type found in DNAScript

DNARunner: The class used to evaluate DNAScript code

DNAScope: The class that does all of the magic lexing/parsing for the language. Oh boy!

DNASpecialScopes: A .SCALA container file for definitions of For and While loops, as well as If statements

To run a DNAScript program, boot up your command line and compile:
> scalac *.scala
Then run the DNARunner program:
> scala DNARunner [string of code]

where [string of code] refers to a literal string of DNAScript
